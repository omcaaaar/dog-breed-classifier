# dog-breed-classifier

In this project, I have built a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. If the image is of a human and not a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

This project is a part of Udacity deep learning nanodegree.
